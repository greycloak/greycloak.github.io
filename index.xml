&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a Fedora 43 laptop (especially something like a Framework with Intel integrated graphics) and you want to generate AI images locally, you can do it — without CUDA, without NVIDIA drivers, and without the heavyweight PyTorch + AUTOMATIC1111 setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide walks through the exact steps that worked for me using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stable-diffusion.cpp&lt;/strong&gt; (fast C++ backend)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sd.cpp-webui&lt;/strong&gt; (simple Gradio-based browser UI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable Diffusion v1.5 safetensors model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python 3.12&lt;/strong&gt; (important!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup is CPU-friendly and runs well on modern laptops.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Headless SSD install on Raspberry Pi 4B</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2023-01-26-headless-ssd-install-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2023-01-26-headless-ssd-install-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I have a Raspberry Pi 4B that I use as a mini home server and pi-hole. I love that I can block intrusive ads, have a secure vpn connection to my home network, and have backup for my music collection. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a fun little device and if you can get your hands on one, it has a lot of cool uses. (Note, if you're having trouble, may I recommend RPILocator.. follow them on Mastadon for real time updates.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free Dynamic DNS with Namecheap for Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-12-30-dynamic-dns-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-12-30-dynamic-dns-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I've got a &lt;a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/"&gt;PiHole&lt;/a&gt; set up on my raspberry pi and have it connected to my home router. My ISP won't assign me a static IP address though it's pretty good about keeping the one I've got active until I reboot my router. For the most part that's been good enough for me but I wanted to finally get dynamic dns going so I wouldn't have to worry about it again. There are some paid solutions out there and my router even supports a few of them by default. I'm a cheapskate though and didn't want to have yet another subscription weighing me down. (Enough is enough!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Make Firefox address bar work like Chrome</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-11-19-firefox-address-bar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-11-19-firefox-address-bar/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I've been using Firefox as my main browser for a few years now. I like supporting an independent organization and have come to really appreciate the containers functionality which helps me segragate activity. One gripe I've had is that I much prefer the way Google Chrome handle's URL completion. When I'm in Chrome and I type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; it automatically autocompletes to &lt;code&gt;https://www.discord.com/app&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, in Firefox typing the same thing autocompletes to &lt;code&gt;https://www.discord.com&lt;/code&gt; even if I've got the full URL bookmarked and have the settings set to just look at my browsing history and bookmarks. It's be a small, but annoying problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Joplin CLI on Raspberry Pi 4</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-08-05-joplin-cli/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-08-05-joplin-cli/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I've been searching for a way to keep my notes and todos organized. Over the years I've tried some interesting solutions like Evernote, Google Tasks, and even Task Warrior. All of them have their pros and cons but I've recently really liked the flexibility and ease of use of &lt;a href="https://joplinapp.org/"&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote earlier about cassettes becoming a more important part of my listening experience. I have bought some great cassettes from my local record store but I also like making my own mixes. Generally, I buy 110 minute type 2 cassettes from Amazon as they're the most convenient place to get a lot of song storage without paying nosebleed prices. To record music, I assemble a playlist on YouTube and then connect the headphone jack on my computer to the line in on my Sony WM-D6C.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Benefits of Cassette Culture</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-05-01-benefits-cassette-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-05-01-benefits-cassette-culture/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm GenX and I grew up on a budget. That meant listening to the radio and trying to record my favorite song onto a cassette tape so I could listen to it in my parent's car or on a cheap portable cassette player on the way to school. When CD's came on the scene, like many others, I jumped on board eager to get perfect sound quality and leave behind clumsy track skipping.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Install Rmagick 3.1 on Archlinux</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-04-16-rmagick-arch-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2019 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-04-16-rmagick-arch-linux/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;So you're doing ruby development in 2019, eh? Good for you! Despite the rumors, Ruby on Rails is still a great way to get a project up and running. I managed to get the core of &lt;a href="https://www.rpgbuddy.com"&gt;https://www.rpgbuddy.com&lt;/a&gt; up and running in a week. One of my clients is also still running Ruby and I need to upgrade them from an old 2.3.3 version to 2.6.2. With that I decided to update a bunch of old gems too.

&lt;p&gt;I was transitioning this blog from using Jekyll to Hexo. After comparing both, I feel I made the right choice. However, I almost started off on the wrong foot. Being unfamiliar with Node.js, I was reviewing the Hexo install instructions and the first thing it tells you is to install via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="ln"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;npm install hexo-cli -g
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm running on Archlinux and got a permission denied error when I tried that. It's likely because I used pacman (the Archlinux package manager) to install node and/or npm. So that left me with the decision of whether to use sudo to force the install. After years of running homebrew, that felt like the wrong decision. And it is. Instead of using sudo, fix permissions or create a new directory. If in doubt, your problem is likely solved by creating a new, local directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting touchscreen events working with Firefox</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-02-01-firefox-with-touch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-02-01-firefox-with-touch/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I bought this laptop with a touchscreen and occasionally find myself using it while surfing websites. Now with Chrome that worked just fine but with Firefox it tends to select areas of text instead of scrolling. That sucks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately it's quite fixable. You just have to modify the .desktop file (or launch from the command line) with an additional environmental option: &lt;code&gt;env MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most linux distributions, the .desktop file is in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.local/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; but you can also modify it globally in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; if you have root.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Giving Archlinux Another Try</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-01-29-giving-arch-another-try/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2019 16:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-01-29-giving-arch-another-try/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I bought an HP Envy x360 a few months ago. It had the right combination of features I wanted. Touchscreen, 360 flip, smaller screen size, and decent graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was I wanted to draw, read, and play games on a computer while running linux. Shouldn't be that hard to do but surpringly, any computers that have a touch screen and can flip are either too big to read on comfortably or have a lousy intel chip.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Install MariaDB in Debian Stretch</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-12-21-install-mariadb-debian/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 16:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-12-21-install-mariadb-debian/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;I recently bought an HP Envy x360 13&amp;quot; with AMD Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 graphics. I'll get into why another time but one of the things that didn't work quite well had to do with the laptop freezing every once in a while. It seemed random at first but some searching revealed that adding a kernel parameter solves the issue. That kernel param is &lt;code&gt;idle=nomwait&lt;/code&gt;. Since it was successful in stopping the freezing, I thought I'd make it permanent.

&lt;p&gt;I've been using ChromeOS as my main development machine for a while now. At first I logged in under my personal gmail and used Crouton for development, but after Crostini I decided to separate out my work and personal items. Here are a few things that still bother me and why I might go back to a full linux environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="multiple-users---sign-out"&gt;Multiple Users - sign out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major problems with multiple users on Chrome. The first is that once you sign in another user, you can't just sign them out. You have to sign out ALL users. This is incredibly annoying because of resources taken keeping another user signed in but also because of the lock screen privacy (see below).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reinstall a broken MySQL 5.7 Ubuntu Xenial</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-31-fix-broken-mysql-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2018 10:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-31-fix-broken-mysql-ubuntu/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that particularly in Ubuntu Xenial, an apt-upgrade to mysql 5.7 fails. A standard re-install doesn't work for me so I've resorted to more extreme methods to get my install working. This is only suitable for development, mind you. Please do not attempt in production without full backups and supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Setting up mysql-server-5.7 (5.7.12-0ubuntu1) ...
Job for mysql.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "systemctl status mysql.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.

Errors were encountered while processing:

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to remove and reinstall also fails. The only solution I've found so far is to completely purge MySQL and reinstall it from scratch. I'm sure you can tweak these instructions to backup and restore your data. Maybe if I swtich back from Postgres I'll be motivated to look that up but for now, restoring the one db that uses MySQL is pretty easy. So what's the process?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fixing keyboard and mouse lag in Xorg (crouton)</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-07-fix-keyboard-lag-crouton/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jul 2018 03:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-07-fix-keyboard-lag-crouton/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;So you've got a new debian install and need to get it set up to do real work? Here's a quick guide to get the packages you need assuming you're using Debian's current testing distro, &lt;code&gt;Buster&lt;/code&gt;, installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's make sure your system is up to date:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let's grab the essentials including git:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="ln"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;sudo apt install git curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs

My particular use case was exporting data from various tables into a CSV file so I could use a 3rd party email service.

&lt;p&gt;Often times I find myself using ssh to get to a server in order to get a file. The problem is that my local machine doesn't have its own publicly accessible IP address. So I end up ssh'ing into the remote server, creating the file I need (e.g. database backup) and then exiting only to run scp from my local machine afterwards. Plus, if after that I want to erase the file on the remote server I have to ssh in again and tidy up after myself. That's me running ssh x2 and scp x1 every time I want to accomplish what should be simple. There's got to be an easier way, right? You bet..&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Swapping Control &amp; Alt in Linux</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2009-04-19-swap-control-alt-linux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2009 23:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2009-04-19-swap-control-alt-linux/</guid><description>
