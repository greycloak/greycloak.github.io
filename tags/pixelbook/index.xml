At first I logged in under my personal gmail and used Crouton for development, but after Crostini I decided to separate out my work and personal items. Here are a few things that still bother me and why I might go back to a full linux environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="multiple-users---sign-out"&gt;Multiple Users - sign out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major problems with multiple users on Chrome. The first is that once you sign in another user, you can't just sign them out. You have to sign out ALL users. This is incredibly annoying because of resources taken keeping another user signed in but also because of the lock screen privacy (see below).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
