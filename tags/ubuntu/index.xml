I bought an HP Envy x360 and out of the box it works pretty well with linux. I've got Ubuntu 18.10 installed and have only had to tweak a couple of minor things. There is however, one big problem and that is the touch screen doesn't work. It might be the HP firmware (I am still figuring out how to update it in linux) but in the meantime, there is a patch available.</description></item><item><title>Fix Occasional Freezing on the HP Envy X360</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-10-31-fix-freezing-envyx360/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 10:09:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-10-31-fix-freezing-envyx360/</guid><description>
01/2019 update: This doesn't seem to be necessary with the 4.20 kernel!
I recently bought an HP Envy x360 13&amp;quot; with AMD Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 graphics. I'll get into why another time but one of the things that didn't work quite well had to do with the laptop freezing every once in a while. It seemed random at first but some searching revealed that adding a kernel parameter solves the issue.</description></item><item><title>Reinstall a broken MySQL 5.7 Ubuntu Xenial</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-31-fix-broken-mysql-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jul 2018 10:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-31-fix-broken-mysql-ubuntu/</guid><description>
I've noticed that particularly in Ubuntu Xenial, an apt-upgrade to mysql 5.7 fails. A standard re-install doesn't work for me so I've resorted to more extreme methods to get my install working. This is only suitable for development, mind you. Please do not attempt in production without full backups and supervision.
Error:
Setting up mysql-server-5.7 (5.7.12-0ubuntu1) ... Job for mysql.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See "</description></item></channel></rss>
