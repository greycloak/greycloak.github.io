&lt;p&gt;I've got a &lt;a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/"&gt;PiHole&lt;/a&gt; set up on my raspberry pi and have it connected to my home router. My ISP won't assign me a static IP address though it's pretty good about keeping the one I've got active until I reboot my router. For the most part that's been good enough for me but I wanted to finally get dynamic dns going so I wouldn't have to worry about it again. There are some paid solutions out there and my router even supports a few of them by default. I'm a cheapskate though and didn't want to have yet another subscription weighing me down. (Enough is enough!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
