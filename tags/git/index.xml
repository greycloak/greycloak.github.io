So you've got a new debian install and need to get it set up to do real work? Here's a quick guide to get the packages you need assuming you're using Debian's current testing distro, Buster, installed.
First, let's make sure your system is up to date:
1sudo apt update 2sudo apt upgrade Next, let's grab the essentials including git:
1sudo apt install git curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs Before we get too far, let's configure git.</description></item><item><title>Quick Tip: Exporting to CSV from Rails console</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2013-10-08-export-rails-to-csv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 10:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2013-10-08-export-rails-to-csv/</guid><description>
This is an ugly solution but one that can come in handy if you just need to get some sample data out of your rails application. My particular use case was exporting data from various tables into a CSV file so I could use a 3rd party email service. We have users in a multi-tenant app so it's not quite so simple as just exporting a single table. This is something you almost certainly don't need to use if your SQL-fu is strong.</description></item></channel></rss>
