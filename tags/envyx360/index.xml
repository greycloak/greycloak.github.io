&lt;p&gt;I bought an HP Envy x360 and out of the box it works pretty well with linux. I've got Ubuntu 18.10 installed and have only had to tweak a couple of minor things.

I'll get into why another time but one of the things that didn't work quite well had to do with the laptop freezing every once in a while. It seemed random at first but some searching revealed that adding a kernel parameter solves the issue. That kernel param is &lt;code&gt;idle=nomwait&lt;/code&gt;. Since it was successful in stopping the freezing, I thought I'd make it permanent. Here's how:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
