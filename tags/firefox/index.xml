I bought this laptop with a touchscreen and occasionally find myself using it while surfing websites. Now with Chrome that worked just fine but with Firefox it tends to select areas of text instead of scrolling. That sucks!
Fortunately it's quite fixable. You just have to modify the .desktop file (or launch from the command line) with an additional environmental option: env MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1
On most linux distributions, the .desktop file is in /usr/local/share/applications or ~/.</description></item></channel></rss>
