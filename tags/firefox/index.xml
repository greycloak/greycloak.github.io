&lt;p&gt;I've been using Firefox as my main browser for a few years now. I like supporting an independent organization and have come to really appreciate the containers functionality which helps me segragate activity. One gripe I've had is that I much prefer the way Google Chrome handle's URL completion. When I'm in Chrome and I type &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; it automatically autocompletes to &lt;code&gt;https://www.discord.com/app&lt;/code&gt; in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, in Firefox typing the same thing autocompletes to &lt;code&gt;https://www.discord.com&lt;/code&gt; even if I've got the full URL bookmarked and have the settings set to just look at my browsing history and bookmarks. It's be a small, but annoying problem for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Getting touchscreen events working with Firefox</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-02-01-firefox-with-touch/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-02-01-firefox-with-touch/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I bought this laptop with a touchscreen and occasionally find myself using it while surfing websites. Now with Chrome that worked just fine but with Firefox it tends to select areas of text instead of scrolling. That sucks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately it's quite fixable. You just have to modify the .desktop file (or launch from the command line) with an additional environmental option: &lt;code&gt;env MOZ_USE_XINPUT2=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most linux distributions, the .desktop file is in &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~/.local/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; but you can also modify it globally in &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/applications&lt;/code&gt; if you have root.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
