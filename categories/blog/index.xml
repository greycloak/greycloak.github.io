&lt;p&gt;I've been searching for a way to keep my notes and todos organized. Over the years I've tried some interesting solutions like Evernote, Google Tasks, and even Task Warrior. All of them have their pros and cons but I've recently really liked the flexibility and ease of use of &lt;a href="https://joplinapp.org/"&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshots will show you that it's got a complete Graphical User Interface and is usable across most operating systems including Linux so if you want to do that, by all means check it out. Installation is pretty straight forward and you won't need this guide.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cassette Mix: 70's Mix 1</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-06-12-70s-mix/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-06-12-70s-mix/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I wrote earlier about cassettes becoming a more important part of my listening experience. I have bought some great cassettes from my local record store but I also like making my own mixes. Generally, I buy 110 minute type 2 cassettes from Amazon as they're the most convenient place to get a lot of song storage without paying nosebleed prices. To record music, I assemble a playlist on YouTube and then connect the headphone jack on my computer to the line in on my Sony WM-D6C.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Benefits of Cassette Culture</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-05-01-benefits-cassette-culture/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 12:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2022-05-01-benefits-cassette-culture/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I'm GenX and I grew up on a budget. That meant listening to the radio and trying to record my favorite song onto a cassette tape so I could listen to it in my parent's car or on a cheap portable cassette player on the way to school. When CD's came on the scene, like many others, I jumped on board eager to get perfect sound quality and leave behind clumsy track skipping.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Giving Archlinux Another Try</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-01-29-giving-arch-another-try/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2019 16:00:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2019-01-29-giving-arch-another-try/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I bought an HP Envy x360 a few months ago. It had the right combination of features I wanted. Touchscreen, 360 flip, smaller screen size, and decent graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was I wanted to draw, read, and play games on a computer while running linux. Shouldn't be that hard to do but surpringly, any computers that have a touch screen and can flip are either too big to read on comfortably or have a lousy intel chip.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ChromeOS Shortcomings</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-10-26-chromeos-shortcomings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:09:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2018-10-26-chromeos-shortcomings/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I've been using ChromeOS as my main development machine for a while now. At first I logged in under my personal gmail and used Crouton for development, but after Crostini I decided to separate out my work and personal items. Here are a few things that still bother me and why I might go back to a full linux environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="multiple-users---sign-out"&gt;Multiple Users - sign out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major problems with multiple users on Chrome. The first is that once you sign in another user, you can't just sign them out. You have to sign out ALL users. This is incredibly annoying because of resources taken keeping another user signed in but also because of the lock screen privacy (see below).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ten Things I Love About ArchLinux</title><link>https://greycloak.com/post/2007-05-31-ten-things-archlinux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 May 2007 10:34:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://greycloak.com/post/2007-05-31-ten-things-archlinux/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;I've been back on Mac OSX for over a year now, using it for all my daily activities from email and web surfing to programming and device syncing. Something has been eating at me though and I find myself pining for my old linux desktop. Since buying a new rig for kicks is out of the question, I instead dug up a beat up IBM T22 and grabbed my Kubuntu Alternative Install CD and went to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
