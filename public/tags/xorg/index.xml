            I&#39;ve been using a Chromebook for development lately. On the side, I like to load up games and play using the linux installation I have loaded up via Crouton. Crouton is amazing and what we&#39;ll be using until native linux comes baked in, but it has some issues. There are a number of &amp;quot;targets&amp;quot; for displaying a desktop environment including xiwi and xorg. Here, I&#39;ll discuss those two targets and tell you how to fix performance in the latter.

            More for my own reference and in preparation of me completely gutting my system, I&#39;m posting the contents of my .xmodmaprc file which swaps the left control and alt-keys. This allows me to use my linux laptop more like I used my mac, with the command key. Many distributions now let you swap this from a setting but if yours doesn&#39;t here is how to go about it.
Feel free to copy the contents to a file called .
