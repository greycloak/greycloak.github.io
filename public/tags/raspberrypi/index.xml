            I&#39;ve been searching for a way to keep my notes and todos organized. Over the years I&#39;ve tried some interesting solutions like Evernote, Google Tasks, and even Task Warrior. All of them have their pros and cons but I&#39;ve recently really liked the flexibility and ease of use of Joplin.
The screenshots will show you that it&#39;s got a complete Graphical User Interface and is usable across most operating systems including Linux so if you want to do that, by all means check it out.
