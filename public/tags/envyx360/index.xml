            I bought an HP Envy x360 and out of the box it works pretty well with linux. I&#39;ve got Ubuntu 18.10 installed and have only had to tweak a couple of minor things. There is however, one big problem and that is the touch screen doesn&#39;t work. It might be the HP firmware (I am still figuring out how to update it in linux) but in the meantime, there is a patch available.

            01/2019 update: This doesn&#39;t seem to be necessary with the 4.20 kernel!
I recently bought an HP Envy x360 13&amp;quot; with AMD Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 graphics. I&#39;ll get into why another time but one of the things that didn&#39;t work quite well had to do with the laptop freezing every once in a while. It seemed random at first but some searching revealed that adding a kernel parameter solves the issue.
