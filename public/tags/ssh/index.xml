            &lt;p&gt;Often times I find myself using ssh to get to a server in order to get a file. The problem is that my local machine doesn&#39;t have its own publicly accessible IP address. So I end up ssh&#39;ing into the remote server, creating the file I need (e.g. database backup) and then exiting only to run scp from my local machine afterwards. Plus, if after that I want to erase the file on the remote server I have to ssh in again and tidy up after myself. That&#39;s me running ssh x2 and scp x1 every time I want to accomplish what should be simple. There&#39;s got to be an easier way, right? You bet..&lt;/p&gt;
