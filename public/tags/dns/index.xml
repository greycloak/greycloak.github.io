            &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.pi-hole.net/&#34;&gt;PiHole&lt;/a&gt; set up on my raspberry pi and have it connected to my home router. My ISP won&#39;t assign me a static IP address though it&#39;s pretty good about keeping the one I&#39;ve got active until I reboot my router. For the most part that&#39;s been good enough for me but I wanted to finally get dynamic dns going so I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it again. There are some paid solutions out there and my router even supports a few of them by default. I&#39;m a cheapskate though and didn&#39;t want to have yet another subscription weighing me down. (Enough is enough!)&lt;/p&gt;
