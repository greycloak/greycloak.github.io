            &lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been searching for a way to keep my notes and todos organized. Over the years I&#39;ve tried some interesting solutions like Evernote, Google Tasks, and even Task Warrior. All of them have their pros and cons but I&#39;ve recently really liked the flexibility and ease of use of &lt;a href=&#34;https://joplinapp.org/&#34;&gt;Joplin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshots will show you that it&#39;s got a complete Graphical User Interface and is usable across most operating systems including Linux so if you want to do that, by all means check it out. Installation is pretty straight forward and you won&#39;t need this guide.&lt;/p&gt;
