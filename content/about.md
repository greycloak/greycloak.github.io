Greycloak is a personal blog about technology, business, culture, and doing the right thing. It exists primarily as a repository of tutorials for my own benefit, but occasionally I write opinions on various other things. I hope you find it useful! Feel free to share or copy anything here but leave a link to the original material and give credit where it's due.

Greycloak is maintained by Vince Wadhwani. Contacting me is easiest via [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/vwadhwani) or <a rel="me" href="https://masto.nyc/@vincew">Mastodon</a>
