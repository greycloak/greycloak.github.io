[{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"I'll admit, I'm GenX and I grew up on a budget. That meant listening to the radio and trying to record my favorite song onto a cassette tape so I could listen to it in my parent's car or on a cheap portable cassette player on the way to school. When CD's came on the scene, like many others, I jumped on board eager to get perfect sound quality and leave behind clumsy track skipping.\nI did miss creating my own mixes but that was eventually solved in the late 90s with MP3s, CD Ripping, and burning.\nEventually I found my way back to tapes and here are the reasons I'm in love:\n Equal distribution of sharing and consumption Limited space means more deliberate choices Listen free, fast, and without distractions Rerecording Immutable  1. Equal distribution of sharing and consumption A while ago, a friend spent 20 seconds finding a YouTube link to a song he wanted me to hear and sending it to me on Slack. I then spent the next 5 minutes listening to the track. Didn't seem like a fair trade. He spent 20 seconds and then I lost 5 minutes. Worse, it happened again.\nSociety as a whole has this problem. Your boss comes up with a crazy idea and asks you to look into it and suddenly their 30 second \u0026quot;epiphany\u0026quot; costs you days or weeks of research and reporting. It may be unavoidable in work but it shouldn't have to be that way with music.\nI countered my friend and asked him if he'd heard of an artist that I liked. When he hadn't, my first thought was not a Spotify or YouTube link, but a cassette tape. Why? I wanted to spend the same time recording the songs that I asked him to invest in listening to it. I was telling him that my time is no more valuable than his and, in making the mixtape for him, I was proving it.\n2. Limited space means more deliberate choices Cassette Tapes come in various forms but they generally vary in length from 60 minutes to 110 minutes. Generally the longer the tape the more fragile it is. Regardless, you don't have storage measured in gigabytes, you have it stored in minutes. Precious few at that, so your choices matter as how you choose. So give it some thought. Choose what you want and then get them on a side of a tape in a combination that creates the most enjoyment with the least amount of wasted space. It's fun and a bit of artistry in itself to pull off a good mix this way.\n3. Listen free, fast, and without distractions I don't always carry a walkman with me. I generally use it when I'm on an airplane and have time to zone out without worrying about missing an important text message or alert. But, any time I open my app the process is something like:\n Unlock screen Find and click on app Navigate to my library Find album/genre/artist or shuffle Dismiss offer to try 1 month of streaming for free  By contrast, with my walkman I just hit play and I'm done. Glorious.\nAnd, while you can absolutely create your own mix tapes, there is also the secondary market where you can buy old cassette tapes of albums you like. I've had to be really discerning with what I buy even though prices are pretty reasonable. (See links for one place you can buy online.)\nWhat albums did I like a few songs on and which ones were remarkable and listening to completely? Those are questions you'll have to answer for yourself.\n4. Rerecording You are noting that a lot of this so far is doable with CDs as well. Sure, a CD burner may go 25x faster than the playback but it's still not as egrigious as sharing a link. And CDs also have limited storage too.\nAh, yes but can you record over that CD Mix?\nWith tapes you can. So whether you find your recording levels off or your taste in songs have changed, you can repurpose that cassette tape and give it new life. You of course, can just buy another cassette and leave it as-is, but the choice is yours.\n5. Immutable That leads to my last point. The music is immutable as long as you want it to be. \u0026quot;But you just said you can rerecord over it, so what gives?\u0026quot; That is definitely true. What I mean is that you are in complete control. You can pick off the write tabs to make sure it can't be changed but one thing is for sure, no 3rd party is going to change it either.\nIf you buy or stream music digitally there's a chance that an artist may take issue with a recorded track and change it after their album is released. When that happens, the version you bought is GONE. Music streaming services are able to completely change a song at any time.. much like a website or any other software update. This does not always mean an improvement either. Personally, I would love to go back to the original software on my Amazon Alexa before it had the \u0026quot;feature\u0026quot; where it would give me \u0026quot;by the way\u0026quot; updates any time I asked for the weather.\nA final thing I love about the revivial of cassette culture is the excitement for finding a great deal. Those are definitely not found on eBay but rather in the real world (remember?) in flea markets, goodwill stores, or at garage sales. The ability to find new sealed cassette tapes or that perfect album, or even a great, working cassette deck. It can be a hobby in itself outside of the music.\nIf you're interested in grabbing a cassette deck or investigating further, here are some links I would recommend:\n The Cassette Culture Subreddit Discogs Reverb  If you have a deck and want to trade some mixes with me, hit me up on Twitter!\ntl;dr  Equal distribution of sharing and consumption Limited space means more deliberate choices Listen free, fast, and without distractions Rerecording Immutable   ","link":"https://example.com/post/2022-05-01-benefits-cassette-culture/","section":"post","tags":["cassette","nostalgia"],"title":"Benefits of Cassette Culture"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/blog/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"blog"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/cassette/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"cassette"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/nostalgia/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"nostalgia"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/hugo/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Hugo"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/syntax/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"syntax"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/series/themes-guide/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Themes Guide"},{"body":"Page bundles are an optional way to organize page resources within Hugo.\nYou can opt-in to using page bundles in Hugo Clarity with usePageBundles in your site configuration or in a page's front matter. Read more about usePageBundles.\nWith page bundles, resources for a page or section, like images or attached files, live in the same directory as the content itself rather than in your static directory.\nHugo Clarity supports the use of leaf bundles, which are any directories within the content directory that contain an index.md file. Hugo's documentation gives this example:\n1content 2├── about 3│ ├── index.md 4├── posts 5│ ├── my-post 6│ │ ├── content1.md 7│ │ ├── content2.md 8│ │ ├── image1.jpg 9│ │ ├── image2.png 10│ │ └── index.md 11│ └── my-other-post 12│ └── index.md 13│ 14└── another-section 15├── .. 16└── not-a-leaf-bundle 17├── .. 18└── another-leaf-bundle 19└── index.md  In the above example `content` directory, there are four leaf bundles: about: This leaf bundle is at the root level (directly under content directory) and has only the index.md.\nmy-post: This leaf bundle has the index.md, two other content Markdown files and two image files. image1 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources. image2 is a page resource of my-post and only available in my-post/index.md resources.\nmy-other-post: This leaf bundle has only the index.md.\nanother-leaf-bundle: This leaf bundle is nested under couple of directories. This bundle also has only the index.md.\nThe hierarchy depth at which a leaf bundle is created does not matter, as long as it is not inside another leaf bundle.\n Advantages to using page bundles The image below is part of the bundle of this page, and is located at content/post/bundle/building.png. Because it's within this page's bundle, the markup for the image only has to specify the image's filename, building.png.\n    If you ever change the name of the directory in which this Markdown file and the image reside, the reference to the image would not need to be updated.\nIn addition to more cleanly organizing your content and related assets, when using page bundles, Hugo Clarity will automatically generate markup for modern image formats, which are smaller in file size.\nFor instance, when you reference an image like building.png, Hugo Clarity will check to see if the same image (based on filename) exists in WebP, AVIF or JXL formats. If you inspect the image above, you'll see a \u0026lt;source\u0026gt; element for building.webp, because that file is also present. Hugo Clarity will only include the markup if these images exist.\nBrowsers that support these formats and the \u0026lt;picture\u0026gt; element will load them, while browsers that do not will fall-back to the default image. Read more about this process.\nFinally, note that page assets can be further managed and refined within the page's front matter if you wish, and are not limited to images alone.\nDisadvantages to using page bundles Page resources in a bundle are only available to the page with which they are bundled — that means you can't include an image with one page and then reference it from another.\nImages that are being used in multiple places are more appropriate for your Hugo assets directory. Unlike files in the Hugo static directory, files in the assets directory can be run through Hugo Pipes, which includes image processing.\n","link":"https://example.com/post/bundle/","section":"post","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Using Hugo page bundles"},{"body":"The \u0026quot;Notices\u0026quot; shortcode enables you to call out pieces of information - sidebars, warnings, tips, etc.\nTo create a notice on a page, you can use the notice shortcode.\nYou use the notice shortcode, with the first parameter being one of note, info, tip, and warning.

After comparing both, I feel I made the right choice. However, I almost started off on the wrong foot. Being unfamiliar with Node.js, I was reviewing the Hexo install instructions and the first thing it tells you is to install via:\n1npm install hexo-cli -g I'm running on Archlinux and got a permission denied error when I tried that. It's likely because I used pacman (the Archlinux package manager) to install node and/or npm. So that left me with the decision of whether to use sudo to force the install. After years of running homebrew, that felt like the wrong decision. And it is. Instead of using sudo, fix permissions or create a new directory. If in doubt, your problem is likely solved by creating a new, local directory.\nThe first step in diagnosing is figuring out where npm is storing its packages.

It had the right combination of features I wanted. Touchscreen, 360 flip, smaller screen size, and decent graphics chip.\nThe plan was I wanted to draw, read, and play games on a computer while running linux. Shouldn't be that hard to do but surpringly, any computers that have a touch screen and can flip are either too big to read on comfortably or have a lousy intel chip.\nWhen I first got the x360 I wanted the easy way out so installed Ubuntu 18.10 on it. Sure enough most things worked. At that time the latest kernel was 4.19.1 so there were a few tweaks I had to make. One to keep the laptop from freezing and another to patch the kernel and allow me to use the touchscreen. But the rest mostly worked.. for a while.\nBy the time I'd upgraded to kernel 4.20 the laptop was no longer suspending properly. Further I had a lot of WiFi breakages. Dozens of searches and my own inquiries on forums could not solve either of those problems. Lastly, one of the last lingering problems was low FPS in my video games despite having upgraded to a newer 19.0 version of Mesa.\nIn the end, I had a choice. Go back to my Pixelbook or reinstall. I opted to reinstall and go with Arch again. Glad I did. This tutorial from Average Linux User was the most straight forward instructions I found. They're nearly flawless except he uses a wired Ethernet connection. wifi-menu ended up working for me so that wasn't a big deal.\nWhen I was done, all my problems ended up going away. WiFi works (though I'm too lazy to figure out how to use NetworkManager for now and it conflicts with wifi-menu), my touchscreen doesn't need to be patched (due to newer kernel), suspend/resume is flawless, and the lag I had with the keyboard while playing Guild Wars 2 is gone. (FPS might be a tick higher too.. hard to confirm).\nOverall, I'm really happy. I even took a vacation and was confident enough to bring only the Arch laptop with me. If you're not familiar with Arch Linux, I highly recommend you give it a try. A while back I wrote an article on why I like it so much. The good parts are still good although some things like rc.conf don't apply anymore. Give it a read and then decide if Arch is right for you.\ntl;dr  Lots of things didn't work in Ubuntu 18.10 All those things work in Arch Linux Installation was made easy following a tutorial Happy to be using Arch Again!

It might be the HP firmware (I am still figuring out how to update it in linux) but in the meantime, there is a patch available. The question is how do we apply it? Let's find out.\nThe first thing you'll need to do is grab a bunch of dependencies. From your command line, let's install them:\n1sudo apt install build-essential git flex bison bc libssl-dev gawk libudev-dev ocl-icd-opencl-dev libpci-dev libelf-dev python2.7 libncurses-dev fakeroot kernel-wedge binfmt-support ksh lsscsi binfmt-support libpcre16-3 libpcre3-dev libpcre32-3 libpcrecpp0v5 libsepol1-dev libattr1-dev libblkid-dev libpcre16-3 libpcre3-dev libpcre32-3 libpcrecpp0v5 libselinux1-dev libsepol1-dev uuid-dev debugedit libarchive13 libdw1 liblua5.2-0 liblzo2-2 libnspr4 libnss3 librpm8 librpmbuild8 librpmio8 librpmsign8 rpm rpm-common rpm2cpio spl-dkms In our example we're going to be applying this patch to the latest kernel which is currently 4.19.6 Let's clone it:\n1git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch v4.19.6 git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel-test/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/mainline-crack v4.19.6 If you look at the website directory in question, you'll see the 6 patch files we need. Let's change into the newly cloned 4.19.6 folder and grab them:\n1cd 4.19.6 2wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0001-base-packaging.patch 3wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0002-UBUNTU-SAUCE-add-vmlinux.strip-to-BOOT_TARGETS1-on-p.patch 4wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0003-UBUNTU-SAUCE-tools-hv-lsvmbus-add-manual-page.patch 5wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0004-debian-changelog.patch 6wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0005-configs-based-on-Ubuntu-4.19.0-8.9.patch We're next going to also grab the patch. Create a file in the same directory and let's called it x360.patch. Open up your favorite text editor and paste the raw patch into it.\nTime to start patching! From the command line:\n1patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0001-base-packaging.patch 2patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0002-UBUNTU-SAUCE-add-vmlinux.strip-to-BOOT_TARGETS1-on-p.patch 3patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0003-UBUNTU-SAUCE-tools-hv-lsvmbus-add-manual-page.patch 4patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0004-debian-changelog.patch 5patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0005-configs-based-on-Ubuntu-4.19.0-8.9.patch 6patch -p1 \u0026lt; x360.patch Note that the file names will probably change depending on the kernel version you are patching. With that done it's time to make the kernel config from current Kernel config:\n1yes \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | make oldconfig And then, let's make the kernel!\n1make deb-pkg This may take a while depending on your machine. If I recall correctly it took a couple of hours on my HP Envy x360. When it's finally done, you'll have a bunch of .deb files in the directory above. We need to install them:\n1cd .. 2sudo dpkg -i linux*4.19*.deb Finally, update grub and reboot:\n1sudo update-grub 2sudo reboot You can check you're on your new kernel by typing uname -r on the command line after reboot. Remember that if anything goes wrong, you haven't erased your old kernel. Hit esc on reboot to get to your grub prompt and then select your older kernel to try to resolve.\nHappy patching!\n","link":"https://example.com/post/2018-11-01-patch-ubuntu-kernel/","section":"post","tags":["linux","ubuntu","kernel","envyx360"],"title":"Patch the Ubuntu Kernel"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/ubuntu/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ubuntu"},{"body":"01/2019 update: This doesn't seem to be necessary with the 4.20 kernel!\nI recently bought an HP Envy x360 13\u0026quot; with AMD Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 graphics.

It seemed random at first but some searching revealed that adding a kernel parameter solves the issue. That kernel param is idle=nomwait. Since it was successful in stopping the freezing, I thought I'd make it permanent. Here's how:\nFirst a side note that if you need to get to the BIOS in the HP x360, you'll need to hit F10 on boot. Also, to get to the GRUB menu, you'll need to try escape. That assumes you went all in and wrote over your windows partition like I did.

At first I logged in under my personal gmail and used Crouton for development, but after Crostini I decided to separate out my work and personal items. Here are a few things that still bother me and why I might go back to a full linux environment:\nMultiple Users - sign out There are two major problems with multiple users on Chrome. The first is that once you sign in another user, you can't just sign them out. You have to sign out ALL users. This is incredibly annoying because of resources taken keeping another user signed in but also because of the lock screen privacy (see below).\nMultiple Users - order matters When I'm logged in first as my work user, if I then sign in with my personal account, I can't access any of the android apps that I have installed under my personal account. Instead, it looks to my work account and see if the app I'm trying to launch is installed there. If not, I'm prompted to install it by the store.\nLikewise, if I'm logged into my personal account first, things that are installed by my work user aren't accessible even when I log in there second. My entire linux installation (Crostini) will not launch. I have to sign out all users, sign in again as my work user first and then access the linux container.\nThis is a productivity killer as well.\nDevelopment - keyboard mappings With most Operating Systems you can configure the keyboard to work like you do. ChromeOS gives you basic options to swap your Alt and Control but there's not much more. For example if you don't like the keybinding to swap between open windows or want to map the assistant key to something else, you are out of luck. Developers are finicky.. we are worried about coding and sometimes muscle memory ends up distracting from our thoughts and costing us productivity. I'm really surprised nobody at Google has complained about this.\nDevelopment - changing your crostini username As of October 2018, Crouton still runs circles around Crostini. You have so much more flexibility. One of those areas is simply in setting your username. By default, Crostini assigns a username that's the same as the account name for your gmail. Now, you can do this with Crostini as well. From Crosh:\ncrosh\u0026gt; vmc start termina (termina) chronos@localhost ~ $ run_container.sh --container_name penguin --shell --user username  The problem is that the files app's sidebar that says \u0026quot;Linux Files\u0026quot; will not work. It's still looking for your ssh file share. Now, you can fix that too:\n\u0026lt;ctrl\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;alt\u0026gt; + t vmc list vmc start termina lxc list lxc exec penguin -- /bin/login -f user.name $ sudo bash $ rm /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run $ systemctl restart sshd $ ln -s /home/user.name /home/username  But at some point, when Crostini gets an upgrade, things are probably going to break again. Essentially just to use your name for Crostini's instance you'll be doing as much work as you might running linux.\nDevelopment - launching crostini in a tab After you install Crostini, you get a shiny new terminal application. It works well enough. It doesn't support tabs but you can install another terminal app like Tilix which will handle things wonderfully for you. Since there are no multiple desktops, I use chrome tabs to switch between my console and IDE. Launching Crostini in a tab is a slow process though:\n Open crosh vmc start termina run_container.sh --container_name penguin --shell --user username  It's a lot to type. Sadly there's no bash history in termina nor does it allow for an alias to be created to quickly launch the linux container. Minor but yet another productivity killer.\nDevelopment - sharing files from outside the shell From the files app you can copy things to the linux container with a copy/paste or cut/paste. But things can't be done currently using the command line. Again, annoying. In Crouton the Downloads folder was shared so if you downloaded a large file you'll only have to change directory or move it over before you interact with it.\nSecurity - tainted clipboards Did you know all your signed in users share the same clipboard? I've been copying and pasting from my personal account and pasting into this editor which is running on my work account. Ouch.\nSecurity - Can't hide usernames on chromeOS lock screen Google does give you the choice to hide screen names on login. This is great because somebody finding your chromebook and turning it on won't have an idea what email or username to try to break in. Things change dramatically if you put your chromebook to sleep though.\nOn resume, the chromebook displays a list of all users currently signed in. This includes their name, picture, and email address. I honestly don't understand how this hasn't been addressed either. If nothing else the same settings for the login screen should apply here. It's just sloppy that it doesn't.\nThere are of course plenty of good things to appreciate about using ChromeOS for development. The ability to backup your entire linux instance is really handy and makes experimenting easy. Also, although audio and graphics acceleration aren't here yet, they will be coming eventually. None of the hassles around sleep resume or bad drivers plague your experience. You can really see how most of the gripes above are minor and could be fixed without too much complexity. The exception might be the login sequence creating resource issues but once Android becomes less important to the ecosystem, I'm sure that could be addressed as well.\n","link":"https://example.com/post/2018-10-26-chromeos-shortcomings/","section":"post","tags":["linux","chromeos","pixelbook"],"title":"ChromeOS Shortcomings"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/pixelbook/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"pixelbook"},{"body":"I've noticed that particularly in Ubuntu Xenial, an apt-upgrade to mysql 5.7 fails.

On the side, I like to load up games and play using the linux installation I have loaded up via Crouton. Crouton is amazing and what we'll be using until native linux comes baked in, but it has some issues. There are a number of \u0026quot;targets\u0026quot; for displaying a desktop environment including xiwi and xorg. Here, I'll discuss those two targets and tell you how to fix performance in the latter.\nThe first target is xiwi. It essentially uses ChromeOS to manage the windows in whichever Desktop Environment you picked (e.g. XFCE). This allows some really neat tricks like launching an application inside a Chrome tab or separately without launching your full Desktop Environment. If I were just messing around in XFCE this would be my choice. Depending on how and the order in which you installed the crouton targets you might launch into XFCE just by typing:\n1sudo startxfce4 -X xiwi The major problem with xiwi is that there's no hardware acceleration. You can check that by installing mesa-utils and running glxinfo or glxgears.\n1sudo apt install mesa-utils 2glxinfo | grep vendor You'll likely see VMWare as the Vendor which means we're emulating hardware acceleration. Just fine for watching videos but it's not going to cut it for most games. Running glxgears will likely show some decent FPS though.\nUp next is xorg. This is going to launch xfce again but this time we're not relying on ChromeOS for anything. The good news here is that hardware acceleration works! The bad news is that there are some performance problems and also that your Chromebook Graphics Card is probably terrible anyway. I can't help with the latter. But let's try to fix some of those performance issues.\nYou might have a laggy mouse. To fix it temporarily, pop open the terminal and type:\n1synclient FingerLow=1 FingerHigh=5 If that fixed your trackpad issue then you can make it permanent on boot by creating a file at /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots/xenial/etc/X11/Xsession.d/80synaptics and entering the above info. The file would end up looking like:\n# Touchpad sensibility (move) synclient FingerLow=1 synclient FingerHigh=5  For the keyboard lag, we'll take a nod from the solution presented in this thread by Adam and copy over the Intel SNA driver.\n1sudo cp /etc/crouton/xorg-intel-sna.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf Exit and re-enter your xorg xfce chroot and let's take a look at the same metrics. This time looking at glxinfo will show a Vendor string of Intel. And glxgears is going to match your screen refresh rate (probably 60fps). Congrats, you've now got hardware acceleration! You probably can't play anything too beefy but you'll have slightly better performance. If you're using Lutris, you might get dxvk enabled as well for an incremental gain.\nLastly, I should mention that I primarily use cli-extra to just work at the command line. I think this is the happy place for Crouton and where most people use it successfully. But regardless, I hope you find your chromebook useful!\n","link":"https://example.com/post/2018-07-07-fix-keyboard-lag-crouton/","section":"post","tags":["chromeos","crouton","xorg"],"title":"Fixing keyboard and mouse lag in Xorg (crouton)"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/postgresql/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"postgresql"},{"body":"In a previous article, we set up your Debian Buster system with git, ruby, and a bash shell that tells you the ruby version and branch.

For the rest of us, here we go:\nrequire 'csv'\nfile = \u0026quot;#{Rails.root}/public/users.csv\u0026quot; userrefs = UserReference.where(:tenant_id =\u0026gt; 7) CSV.open( file, 'w' ) do |writer| userrefs.each do |ur| next unless ur.user.present? writer \u0026lt;\u0026lt; [ur.user.username, ur.user.email] end end  So what's going on here? Well, first things first we require the CSV library since we'll be manipulating a CSV file.\nNext, we create a string that points to that file (make sure the file is created first). The userrefs variable grabs the top level data you need and from there we cycle though them adding records to our CSV file based on any associations we have. Done!\nPretty straight-forward but handy to have in a pinch!\n","link":"https://example.com/post/2013-10-08-export-rails-to-csv/","section":"post","tags":["ruby","rails","git"],"title":"Quick Tip: Exporting to CSV from Rails console"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/rails/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"rails"},{"body":"Often times I find myself using ssh to get to a server in order to get a file. The problem is that my local machine doesn't have its own publicly accessible IP address. So I end up ssh'ing into the remote server, creating the file I need (e.g. database backup) and then exiting only to run scp from my local machine afterwards. Plus, if after that I want to erase the file on the remote server I have to ssh in again and tidy up after myself. That's me running ssh x2 and scp x1 every time I want to accomplish what should be simple. There's got to be an easier way, right? You bet..\nFirst thing you'll want to do is ssh into your server but this time we're going to pass a -R flag and a port number. That flag \u0026quot;Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.\u0026quot; Basically a reverse tunnel..\n1ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 youruser@yourserver.com Once you're in, you can ssh back to localhost:\n1ssh localhost -p 19999 or copy a file down:\n1scp -P19999 YOUR_FILE youruser@localhost:/home/youruser/ And that is all there is to it!

Something has been eating at me though and I find myself pining for my old linux desktop. Since buying a new rig for kicks is out of the question, I instead dug up a beat up IBM T22 and grabbed my Kubuntu Alternative Install CD and went to it.\nUnfortunately, Kubuntu didn't install in the two times I tried it. It's unusual and is probably a reflection of my hardware more than it is Ubuntu. Still, I had an itch to scratch and I was determined to get at it. Enter Arch Linux. I've used Arch before and this article isn't about how it does on the Desktop or how well it installs. If you want to figure that out go find a review or, better yet, grab an ISO and install it yourself. (Arch installs nicely on VMWare Fusion BTW..)\nAfter getting up and running with Arch again, I discovered there are things about it that I just absolutely love. Here are my top 10.\n  It's fast. Yes, it's an i686 distro and while you might think that I'd grow impatient waiting for an application to launch on my aging 128MB RAM T22, you'd be wrong. It's actually quite snappy and I'm surprised. I've got both KDE and Fluxbox installed and they are both serviceable. Lack of bloat is a good thing.\n  It's got a lean base. I recall a few years ago when I was overseas, I made a bad, stupid, mistake that ruined my linux install. I didn't bring a spare ISO with me but I needed to get work done. I had the choice of downloading a slew of distros but ended up grabbing Archlinux. The lean 140MB base CD downloaded in a few hours (slooow connections overseas back then) and installed in under 25 minutes. From there was I able to start downloading applications in one terminal while simultaneously working in the other.\n  It's unbiased. KDE? Fluxbox? Gnome? Who cares! With Arch, you make the decisions so if you don't want something don't install it. If you want something, go grab it. Nothing is given more attention than the other and that's because the community has a varied user base with their own preferences. Somebody in there uses a similar setup to the one you're thinking about.\n  The community. It's been said that some people use *nix because they hate Windows while other use *nix because they love Unix. (I've left the exact phrase vague for fear of starting a flame war.) I think I use Archlinux because I love linux and I think many in the Arch community feel the same way. The result is a strong, respectful community forum, a well documented wiki, and nice IRC Channel too.\n  RC.CONF. Wait, you love Archlinux because of a file? Yes I do. Everything you need to mess with is in this file. Want to start a daemon on boot? Here you go. Want to eliminate a module from getting loaded? It's in there too. What about setting your IP address? Yup, it's covered. Overall, I find it lovely and I think many Arch users would agree.\n  Pacman. Arch comes with a great, powerful package manager too. Unlike his peers, Pacman won't start installing packages without asking you first. What I mean by that is if you do a sudo apt-get install Foo, it'll go and do it. OTOH, if you type pacman -S Foo, you'll get a breakdown of what's being installed and then pacman will request permission to go ahead.\n  It's a learning distro. Yeah, you need to know linux to really use it. Sure, it doesn't auto configure much. (In fact, sometimes I feel it screws up some things on purpose just to see if you're paying attention!) X11 won't work by default and neither will sound, suspend to ram, or much of anything else. But, it's all manageable thanks to the great community and documentation and you will learn a ton about linux while doing it. Much of that learning will stay with you no matter which distro you end up with.\n  It rolls with it. Arch is a rolling distro so it's always up to date. Simply typing pacman -Syu will update your installation to the latest greatest everything. Sounds like a nightmare for a server but it's actually never let me down even after long periods of neglecting it. Still, I looove my install so I care and feed it daily. It blooms.\n  It's current. With Arch, the packages are in the repository very quickly after they're released. Sometimes it doesn't become generally available (they do test) but if you want it you can enable the testing repository and help out with the bug hunt. Regardless, it's my experience that the versions of the packages in Arch are always further along. It's nice to have the latest greatest and it's also nice to know if a current version of a package fixes or adds a feature I'm interested in. If so, I'll take the time to compile it on the linux distro I use for my servers (Ubuntu).\n  Ok, there's no number 10 and I lied.. this is just a Top 9. Sorry folks! Take a minute to suggest a 10th thing and maybe I'll append it to this list.\n  In any case, Arch isn't the only distro with the above great things and I obviously am not trying to imply that it's better than your favorite distro either. But, I do really enjoy it. A little later on I'll probably publish my list of 5 things I hate about Archlinux. But I'm only up to two at this point so it'll be a while until that list is fully compiled. Still, I'm sure some of you have suggestions for me. ;)\n","link":"https://example.com/post/2007-05-31-ten-things-archlinux/","section":"post","tags":["archlinux","linux"],"title":"Ten Things I Love About ArchLinux"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"}]
