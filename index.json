I love that I can block intrusive ads, have a secure vpn connection to my home network, and have backup for my music collection. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a fun little device and if you can get your hands on one, it has a lot of cool uses. (Note, if you're having trouble, may I recommend RPILocator.. follow them on Mastadon for real time updates.)\nOne of my concerns was the reliance on using a micro SD card for my entire storage and Operating System. I decided to transition over to a SATA SSD and I'd like to show you some of the troubles I ran into and how I overcame them.\nThe Right Hardware I decided on the Western Digital 1 TB SATA SSD. It supports B+M key SSDs which is important to note.\nAfter a false start with a Geekworm adapter, I went with this Argon case. This take a little assembly but it will support the SSD I purchased above.\nInstall software As always, update your Pi to the latest version first.\n1$ sudo apt update 2$ sudo apt upgrade I struggled to get Pi Clone working so you may need to run\n1$ sudo rpi-upgrade There's a good chance you can skip this step but if you have trouble later on, such as with setting USB boot, come back to this step.\nNext, I installed piclone which is what I used to copy the Micro SD to the SATA SSD.\n1$ sudo apt install piclone gvfs Note, you will absolutely need gvfs otherwise piclone will note work.\nIf you haven't already, enable being able X11 ssh by editing your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and setting\nX11Forwarding yes Next you can ssh into your pi using ssh -X. Change the credentials below for your user:\n1$ ssh -X pi@raspberrypi Once you're in, you will need to launch the piclone copier.\nThe first pitfall is how you're going to run a GUI sudo command from X. Check out this handy blog which will guide you through using X11-Forwarding via SSH as a root or sudo user.\nOnce you can run a GUI app as root via ssh, the next pitfall is how you must launch piclone - which is using sudo and via dbus. I'd tried just using sudo piclone which will not work.\n1$ sudo dbus-launch piclone From there you'll have the piclone GUI pop up and, if all has gone well you'll be able to copy the microsd card to your SSD. Depending on the size of the microsd, this may take a while. If you don't see the copy to/from options, again double check you have gvfs installed.\nIf you run into more trouble, you may be able to find a solution on the GitHub issue.\nBoot Order Now you've got an SSD installed using the Argon case, copied the Micro SD card to your SSD, and you've hopefully confirmed that copy was successful by checking the contents of the SSD from the linux command line. The last thing to do is to set the boot ROM and boot order. Start by running the raspi-config utility:\n1$ sudo raspi-config Scroll down to the Advanced Options, Select A6 Boot Order and then finally B2 to Boot from USB if available, otherwise boot from SD Card. Lastly you can exit. Select this option to boot from your SSD first If you needed to upload the ROM, you'll also need to go to the Advanced Options and choose option A7 to update the Bootloader version to use the most recent one you got from rpi-upgrade if you ran it.\nA restart from here should see your Raspberry Pi booting from your newly installed SSD. From here, consider using the Micro SD card as a backup. (Topic to be covered in the future.)\n1$ sudo reboot It is a bit outdated but a step by step can be found on YouTube albeit this version requires a monitor to be hooked up to your Pi.\nAs a last step, I'd strongly recommend undoing any work you did to open up ssh including the X11 Forwarding unless you actually need it.\nSources:\n[1] https://www.simplified.guide/ssh/x11-forwarding-as-root\n[2] https://www.q4os.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2675\n[3] https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/piclone/issues/14\n[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8nzkLryGmM\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2023-01-26-headless-ssd-install-raspberry-pi/","section":"post","tags":["linux","raspberrypi","storage"],"title":"Headless SSD install on Raspberry Pi 4B"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Index"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/linux/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Linux"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/raspberrypi/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Raspberrypi"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/storage/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Storage"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/categories/tutorial/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Tutorial"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/dns/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Dns"},{"body":"I've got a PiHole set up on my raspberry pi and have it connected to my home router. My ISP won't assign me a static IP address though it's pretty good about keeping the one I've got active until I reboot my router. For the most part that's been good enough for me but I wanted to finally get dynamic dns going so I wouldn't have to worry about it again. There are some paid solutions out there and my router even supports a few of them by default. I'm a cheapskate though and didn't want to have yet another subscription weighing me down. (Enough is enough!)\nMy Registrar and DNS provider for the last decade or so has been Namecheap. They're not paying me to say this, but these guys rock. I've never had a problem with them, never had them show up in my news feed for some negative BS, and any time I've needed support their team has been there quickly and with helpful solutions. So my first choice was to see if I could use them for Dynamic DNS too. Turns out the answer is YES.\nA prerequisite is you've got to have a domain over at Namecheap and use them as the DNS provider as well. With that out of the way, here's what you need to do.\nHead over to your domain's advanced DNS section and create an \u0026quot;A+ Dynamic DNS Record\u0026quot; Enter a subdomain (e.g. vpn.example.com) and just use a dummy ip address for now (e.g. 2.2.1.1)\nAt the bottom you'll see a toggle switch for Dynamic DNS. Switch it on and take note of the password\nYou are now done with Namecheap. The next steps will require you to be on the device you'd like to automatically access when its IP changes. In my case it's a Raspberry Pi 4B running Raspberry Pi OS. I've ssh'd into my Pi and updated and upgraded:\n1$ sudo apt update 2$ sudo apt upgrade Next, it's time to install ddclient\n1$ sudo apt install ddclient In my experience the wizard here is pretty good but I ended up modifying the configuration file manually and then testing it out to make sure it worked. Just go ahead and fill in whatever you'd like with the wizard and then when done, edit the conf file:\n1$ sudo vi /etc/ddclient.conf Once that's up, edit it so it looks like this. Below, use your domain and password from namecheap.\n1# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf 2# 3# /etc/ddclient.conf 4 5protocol=namecheap \\ 6ssl=yes 7use=web, web=https://api.ipify.org/ \\ 8login=your-actual-domain.org \\ 9password=\u0026#39;namecheap-generated-password\u0026#39; \\ 10subdomain-you-selected-in-step-1.your-actual-domain.org After you've saved the file, you can test to see if it works. From the console, let's run ddclient manually and see if we get good output:\n1$ sudo ddclient -daemon=0 -noquiet -debug If the test worked you'll see the output telling you so. Next you'll be able to log back in to your namecheap console, visit your domain and see that the A+ Dyanamic DNS record you'd previously temporarily set to a dummy IP has now been updated to reflect your correct IP address. Congratulations, you're done! If you need help, I highly recommend talking with Namecheap's support. Otherwise you can find documentation over at the ddclient homepage.\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2022-12-30-dynamic-dns-raspberry-pi/","section":"post","tags":["linux","raspberrypi","dns"],"title":"Free Dynamic DNS with Namecheap for Raspberry Pi"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/firefox/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Firefox"},{"body":"I've been using Firefox as my main browser for a few years now. I like supporting an independent organization and have come to really appreciate the containers functionality which helps me segragate activity. One gripe I've had is that I much prefer the way Google Chrome handle's URL completion. When I'm in Chrome and I type d it automatically autocompletes to https://www.discord.com/app in the address bar.\nBy contrast, in Firefox typing the same thing autocompletes to https://www.discord.com even if I've got the full URL bookmarked and have the settings set to just look at my browsing history and bookmarks. It's be a small, but annoying problem for me.\nI can't say when the change was made but I finally discovered the solution!\n11 - Go to about:config 22 - search for autofill 33 - change browser.urlbar.autoFill.adaptiveHistory.enabled to true 44 - restart the browser After following the above steps, it should work just like Chrome.

Over the years I've tried some interesting solutions like Evernote, Google Tasks, and even Task Warrior. All of them have their pros and cons but I've recently really liked the flexibility and ease of use of Joplin.\nThe screenshots will show you that it's got a complete Graphical User Interface and is usable across most operating systems including Linux so if you want to do that, by all means check it out. Installation is pretty straight forward and you won't need this guide.\nHowever, if you prefer to use the terminal like I do, Joplin also comes with a command line interface which you can use to create, edit, delete notes and todos using a familiar interface. You can even use your editor of choice and customize the keybindings.\nI recently got myself a Raspberry Pi 4 model B and decided to install Joplin. I'm using it headless so I only want the CLI. Joplin does support this but if you're on Manjaro like I am you'll need to install a few packages first.\n$ sudo pacman -S base-devel libheif libjxl rsync jq libgsf libvips openjpeg2 yq lcms2 openslide poppler-glib imagemagick Now you've got the basics, go ahead and install nodejs. I prefer to do it using nvm. Their webpage has the install instructions and you should use those rather than copying a shell command from a blog. :)\nOnce nvm is install, go ahead and install node. I prefer the LTS version which you can install with\n$ nvm install --lts Lastly, you should be ready to go with Joplin. Their webpage also has the commands so check there for updates but it's as simple as:\nNPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.joplin-bin npm install -g joplin sudo ln -s ~/.joplin-bin/bin/joplin /usr/bin/joplin Keep in mind you may need to reload your terminal to launch it, but you should be good to go.\nIf you're a vim user like me, keep in mind you can customize the keybindings. The only one I find a little annoying is that quitting Joplin itself is done with q instead of :q but hopefully that can get addressed at some point. I've forked the keybindings I use and you see the gist here. Simply put that file in ~/.config/joplin/keymap.json and restart.\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2022-08-05-joplin-cli/","section":"post","tags":["linux","raspberrypi","manjaro"],"title":"Joplin CLI on Raspberry Pi 4"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/manjaro/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Manjaro"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/cassette/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Cassette"},{"body":"I wrote earlier about cassettes becoming a more important part of my listening experience.

That meant listening to the radio and trying to record my favorite song onto a cassette tape so I could listen to it in my parent's car or on a cheap portable cassette player on the way to school. When CD's came on the scene, like many others, I jumped on board eager to get perfect sound quality and leave behind clumsy track skipping.\nI did miss creating my own mixes but that was eventually solved in the late 90s with MP3s, CD Ripping, and burning.\nEventually I found my way back to tapes and here are the reasons I'm in love:\nEqual distribution of sharing and consumption Limited space means more deliberate choices Listen free, fast, and without distractions Rerecording Immutable 1. Equal distribution of sharing and consumption A while ago, a friend spent 20 seconds finding a YouTube link to a song he wanted me to hear and sending it to me on Slack. I then spent the next 5 minutes listening to the track. Didn't seem like a fair trade. He spent 20 seconds and then I lost 5 minutes. Worse, the same thing happened twice.\nSociety as a whole has this problem. Your boss comes up with a crazy idea and asks you to look into it and suddenly their 30 second \u0026quot;epiphany\u0026quot; costs you days or weeks of research and reporting. It may be unavoidable at work but it shouldn't have to be that way with music.\nI countered my friend and asked him if he'd heard of an artist whom I liked. When he hadn't, my first thought was not a Spotify or YouTube link, but a cassette tape. Why? I wanted to spend the same time recording the songs that I asked him to invest in listening to it. I was telling him that my time is no more valuable than his and, in making the mixtape for him, I was proving it.\n2. Limited space means more deliberate choices Cassette Tapes come in various forms but they generally vary in length from 60 minutes to 110 minutes. Generally the longer the tape the more fragile it is. Regardless, you don't have storage measured in gigabytes, you have it stored in minutes. Precious few at that, so your choices matter as how you choose the contents. So, give it some thought! Choose the music you want - and then get them on a single side of a tape in a combination that creates the most enjoyment with the least amount of wasted space. It's fun and a bit of artistry in itself to pull off a good mix this way.\nYou must carefully weigh your choices and balance the time creating your tape with listening to it 3. Listen free, fast, and without distractions I don't always carry a walkman with me. I generally use it when I'm on an airplane and have time to zone out without worrying about missing an important text message or alert. But, any time I open my app the process is something like:\nUnlock screen Find and click on app Navigate to my library Find album/genre/artist or shuffle Dismiss offer to try 1 month of streaming for free By contrast, with my walkman I just hit play and I'm done. Glorious.\nAnd, while you can absolutely create your own mix tapes, there is also the secondary market where you can buy old cassette tapes of albums you like. I've had to be really discerning with what I buy even though prices are pretty reasonable. (See links for one place you can buy online.)\nWhich albums did I like a few songs on and which were the remarkable ones worth listening to completely? That is a question you'll have to answer for yourself. For me, Master of Puppets, Dark Side of the Moon, Ten, and Dookie made the short list.\n4. Rerecording You are noting that a lot of this so far is doable with CDs as well. Sure, a CD burner may go 25x faster than the playback but it's still not as egrigious as sharing a link. And CDs also have limited storage too.\nAh, yes but can you record over that CD Mix?\nWith tapes you can. So whether you find your recording levels off or your taste in songs have changed, you can repurpose that cassette tape and give it new life. You of course, can just buy another cassette and leave it as-is, but the choice is yours.\n5. Immutable That leads to my last point. The music is immutable as long as you want it to be. \u0026quot;But you just said you can rerecord over it, so what gives?\u0026quot; That is definitely true. What I mean is that you are in complete control. You can pick off the write tabs to make sure it can't be changed but one thing is for sure, no 3rd party is going to change it either.\nIf you buy or stream music digitally there's a chance that an artist may take issue with a recorded track and change it after their album is released. When that happens, the version you bought is GONE. Music streaming services are able to completely change a song at any time.. much like a website or any other software update. This does not always mean an improvement either. Personally, I would love to go back to the original software on my Amazon Alexa before it had the \u0026quot;feature\u0026quot; where it would give me \u0026quot;by the way\u0026quot; updates any time I asked for the weather.\nA final thing I love about the revivial of cassette culture is the excitement for finding a great deal. Those are definitely not found on eBay but rather in the real world (remember?) in flea markets, goodwill stores, or at garage sales. The ability to find new sealed cassette tapes or that perfect album, or even a great, working cassette deck. It can be a hobby in itself outside of the music.\nIf you're interested in grabbing a cassette deck or investigating further, here are some links I would recommend:\nThe Cassette Culture Subreddit Discogs Reverb If you have a deck and want to trade some mixes with me, hit me up on Twitter!\ntl;dr Equal distribution of sharing and consumption Limited space means more deliberate choices Listen free, fast, and without distractions Rerecording Immutable ","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2022-05-01-benefits-cassette-culture/","section":"post","tags":["cassette","nostalgia"],"title":"Benefits of Cassette Culture"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/archlinux/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Archlinux"},{"body":"So you're doing ruby development in 2019, eh?

Being unfamiliar with Node.js, I was reviewing the Hexo install instructions and the first thing it tells you is to install via:\n1npm install hexo-cli -g I'm running on Archlinux and got a permission denied error when I tried that. It's likely because I used pacman (the Archlinux package manager) to install node and/or npm. So that left me with the decision of whether to use sudo to force the install. After years of running homebrew, that felt like the wrong decision. And it is. Instead of using sudo, fix permissions or create a new directory. If in doubt, your problem is likely solved by creating a new, local directory.\nThe first step in diagnosing is figuring out where npm is storing its packages. To do that, I ran\n1npm config get prefix and found that my directory was set to /usr. I didn't want to change the permissions of /usr so knew that I needed to switch the directory where the node packages are installed.

It had the right combination of features I wanted. Touchscreen, 360 flip, smaller screen size, and decent graphics chip.\nThe plan was I wanted to draw, read, and play games on a computer while running linux. Shouldn't be that hard to do but surpringly, any computers that have a touch screen and can flip are either too big to read on comfortably or have a lousy intel chip.\nWhen I first got the x360 I wanted the easy way out so installed Ubuntu 18.10 on it. Sure enough most things worked. At that time the latest kernel was 4.19.1 so there were a few tweaks I had to make. One to keep the laptop from freezing and another to patch the kernel and allow me to use the touchscreen. But the rest mostly worked.. for a while.\nBy the time I'd upgraded to kernel 4.20 the laptop was no longer suspending properly. Further I had a lot of WiFi breakages. Dozens of searches and my own inquiries on forums could not solve either of those problems. Lastly, one of the last lingering problems was low FPS in my video games despite having upgraded to a newer 19.0 version of Mesa.\nIn the end, I had a choice. Go back to my Pixelbook or reinstall. I opted to reinstall and go with Arch again. Glad I did. This tutorial from Average Linux User was the most straight forward instructions I found. They're nearly flawless except he uses a wired Ethernet connection. wifi-menu ended up working for me so that wasn't a big deal.\nWhen I was done, all my problems ended up going away. WiFi works (though I'm too lazy to figure out how to use NetworkManager for now and it conflicts with wifi-menu), my touchscreen doesn't need to be patched (due to newer kernel), suspend/resume is flawless, and the lag I had with the keyboard while playing Guild Wars 2 is gone. (FPS might be a tick higher too.. hard to confirm).\nOverall, I'm really happy. I even took a vacation and was confident enough to bring only the Arch laptop with me. If you're not familiar with Arch Linux, I highly recommend you give it a try. A while back I wrote an article on why I like it so much. The good parts are still good although some things like rc.conf don't apply anymore.

It might be the HP firmware (I am still figuring out how to update it in linux) but in the meantime, there is a patch available. The question is how do we apply it? Let's find out.\nThe first thing you'll need to do is grab a bunch of dependencies. From your command line, let's install them:\n1sudo apt install build-essential git flex bison bc libssl-dev gawk libudev-dev ocl-icd-opencl-dev libpci-dev libelf-dev python2.7 libncurses-dev fakeroot kernel-wedge binfmt-support ksh lsscsi binfmt-support libpcre16-3 libpcre3-dev libpcre32-3 libpcrecpp0v5 libsepol1-dev libattr1-dev libblkid-dev libpcre16-3 libpcre3-dev libpcre32-3 libpcrecpp0v5 libselinux1-dev libsepol1-dev uuid-dev debugedit libarchive13 libdw1 liblua5.2-0 liblzo2-2 libnspr4 libnss3 librpm8 librpmbuild8 librpmio8 librpmsign8 rpm rpm-common rpm2cpio spl-dkms In our example we're going to be applying this patch to the latest kernel which is currently 4.19.6 Let's clone it:\n1git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch v4.19.6 git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel-test/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/mainline-crack v4.19.6 If you look at the website directory in question, you'll see the 6 patch files we need. Let's change into the newly cloned 4.19.6 folder and grab them:\n1cd 4.19.6 2wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0001-base-packaging.patch 3wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0002-UBUNTU-SAUCE-add-vmlinux.strip-to-BOOT_TARGETS1-on-p.patch 4wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0003-UBUNTU-SAUCE-tools-hv-lsvmbus-add-manual-page.patch 5wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0004-debian-changelog.patch 6wget http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v4.19.6/0005-configs-based-on-Ubuntu-4.19.0-8.9.patch We're next going to also grab the patch. Create a file in the same directory and let's called it x360.patch. Open up your favorite text editor and paste the raw patch into it.\nTime to start patching! From the command line:\n1patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0001-base-packaging.patch 2patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0002-UBUNTU-SAUCE-add-vmlinux.strip-to-BOOT_TARGETS1-on-p.patch 3patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0003-UBUNTU-SAUCE-tools-hv-lsvmbus-add-manual-page.patch 4patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0004-debian-changelog.patch 5patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0005-configs-based-on-Ubuntu-4.19.0-8.9.patch 6patch -p1 \u0026lt; x360.patch Note that the file names will probably change depending on the kernel version you are patching. With that done it's time to make the kernel config from current Kernel config:\n1yes \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | make oldconfig And then, let's make the kernel!\n1make deb-pkg This may take a while depending on your machine. If I recall correctly it took a couple of hours on my HP Envy x360. When it's finally done, you'll have a bunch of .deb files in the directory above. We need to install them:\n1cd .. 2sudo dpkg -i linux*4.19*.deb Finally, update grub and reboot:\n1sudo update-grub 2sudo reboot You can check you're on your new kernel by typing uname -r on the command line after reboot. Remember that if anything goes wrong, you haven't erased your old kernel. Hit esc on reboot to get to your grub prompt and then select your older kernel to try to resolve.\nHappy patching!\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2018-11-01-patch-ubuntu-kernel/","section":"post","tags":["linux","ubuntu","kernel","envyx360"],"title":"Patch the Ubuntu Kernel"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/ubuntu/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Ubuntu"},{"body":"01/2019 update: This doesn't seem to be necessary with the 4.20 kernel!\nI recently bought an HP Envy x360 13\u0026quot; with AMD Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 graphics. I'll get into why another time but one of the things that didn't work quite well had to do with the laptop freezing every once in a while. It seemed random at first but some searching revealed that adding a kernel parameter solves the issue. That kernel param is idle=nomwait. Since it was successful in stopping the freezing, I thought I'd make it permanent. Here's how:\nFirst a side note that if you need to get to the BIOS in the HP x360, you'll need to hit F10 on boot. Also, to get to the GRUB menu, you'll need to try escape. That assumes you went all in and wrote over your windows partition like I did. If you didn't then your boot options might be different.\nAnyway, here we go:\n1gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub Find the line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and append idle=nomwait to the end.\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\u0026quot;quiet splash idle=nomwait\u0026quot; Next, run the following command:\n1sudo update-grub On the next reboot, the kernel will be started with the new boot parameter.

At first I logged in under my personal gmail and used Crouton for development, but after Crostini I decided to separate out my work and personal items. Here are a few things that still bother me and why I might go back to a full linux environment:\nMultiple Users - sign out There are two major problems with multiple users on Chrome. The first is that once you sign in another user, you can't just sign them out. You have to sign out ALL users. This is incredibly annoying because of resources taken keeping another user signed in but also because of the lock screen privacy (see below).\nMultiple Users - order matters When I'm logged in first as my work user, if I then sign in with my personal account, I can't access any of the android apps that I have installed under my personal account. Instead, it looks to my work account and see if the app I'm trying to launch is installed there. If not, I'm prompted to install it by the store.\nLikewise, if I'm logged into my personal account first, things that are installed by my work user aren't accessible even when I log in there second. My entire linux installation (Crostini) will not launch. I have to sign out all users, sign in again as my work user first and then access the linux container.\nThis is a productivity killer as well.\nDevelopment - keyboard mappings With most Operating Systems you can configure the keyboard to work like you do. ChromeOS gives you basic options to swap your Alt and Control but there's not much more. For example if you don't like the keybinding to swap between open windows or want to map the assistant key to something else, you are out of luck. Developers are finicky.. we are worried about coding and sometimes muscle memory ends up distracting from our thoughts and costing us productivity. I'm really surprised nobody at Google has complained about this.\nDevelopment - changing your crostini username As of October 2018, Crouton still runs circles around Crostini. You have so much more flexibility. One of those areas is simply in setting your username. By default, Crostini assigns a username that's the same as the account name for your gmail. Now, you can do this with Crostini as well. From Crosh:\ncrosh\u0026gt; vmc start termina (termina) chronos@localhost ~ $ run_container.sh --container_name penguin --shell --user username The problem is that the files app's sidebar that says \u0026quot;Linux Files\u0026quot; will not work. It's still looking for your ssh file share. Now, you can fix that too:\n\u0026lt;ctrl\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;alt\u0026gt; + t vmc list vmc start termina lxc list lxc exec penguin -- /bin/login -f user.name $ sudo bash $ rm /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run $ systemctl restart sshd $ ln -s /home/user.name /home/username But at some point, when Crostini gets an upgrade, things are probably going to break again. Essentially just to use your name for Crostini's instance you'll be doing as much work as you might running linux.\nDevelopment - launching crostini in a tab After you install Crostini, you get a shiny new terminal application. It works well enough. It doesn't support tabs but you can install another terminal app like Tilix which will handle things wonderfully for you. Since there are no multiple desktops, I use chrome tabs to switch between my console and IDE. Launching Crostini in a tab is a slow process though:\nOpen crosh vmc start termina run_container.sh --container_name penguin --shell --user username It's a lot to type. Sadly there's no bash history in termina nor does it allow for an alias to be created to quickly launch the linux container. Minor but yet another productivity killer.\nDevelopment - sharing files from outside the shell From the files app you can copy things to the linux container with a copy/paste or cut/paste. But things can't be done currently using the command line. Again, annoying. In Crouton the Downloads folder was shared so if you downloaded a large file you'll only have to change directory or move it over before you interact with it.\nSecurity - tainted clipboards Did you know all your signed in users share the same clipboard? I've been copying and pasting from my personal account and pasting into this editor which is running on my work account. Ouch.\nSecurity - Can't hide usernames on chromeOS lock screen Google does give you the choice to hide screen names on login. This is great because somebody finding your chromebook and turning it on won't have an idea what email or username to try to break in. Things change dramatically if you put your chromebook to sleep though.\nOn resume, the chromebook displays a list of all users currently signed in. This includes their name, picture, and email address. I honestly don't understand how this hasn't been addressed either. If nothing else the same settings for the login screen should apply here. It's just sloppy that it doesn't.\nThere are of course plenty of good things to appreciate about using ChromeOS for development. The ability to backup your entire linux instance is really handy and makes experimenting easy. Also, although audio and graphics acceleration aren't here yet, they will be coming eventually. None of the hassles around sleep resume or bad drivers plague your experience. You can really see how most of the gripes above are minor and could be fixed without too much complexity. The exception might be the login sequence creating resource issues but once Android becomes less important to the ecosystem, I'm sure that could be addressed as well.\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2018-10-26-chromeos-shortcomings/","section":"post","tags":["linux","chromeos","pixelbook"],"title":"ChromeOS Shortcomings"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/pixelbook/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Pixelbook"},{"body":"I've noticed that particularly in Ubuntu Xenial, an apt-upgrade to mysql 5.7 fails.

On the side, I like to load up games and play using the linux installation I have loaded up via Crouton. Crouton is amazing and what we'll be using until native linux comes baked in, but it has some issues. There are a number of \u0026quot;targets\u0026quot; for displaying a desktop environment including xiwi and xorg. Here, I'll discuss those two targets and tell you how to fix performance in the latter.\nThe first target is xiwi. It essentially uses ChromeOS to manage the windows in whichever Desktop Environment you picked (e.g. XFCE). This allows some really neat tricks like launching an application inside a Chrome tab or separately without launching your full Desktop Environment. If I were just messing around in XFCE this would be my choice. Depending on how and the order in which you installed the crouton targets you might launch into XFCE just by typing:\n1sudo startxfce4 -X xiwi The major problem with xiwi is that there's no hardware acceleration. You can check that by installing mesa-utils and running glxinfo or glxgears.\n1sudo apt install mesa-utils 2glxinfo | grep vendor You'll likely see VMWare as the Vendor which means we're emulating hardware acceleration. Just fine for watching videos but it's not going to cut it for most games. Running glxgears will likely show some decent FPS though.\nUp next is xorg. This is going to launch xfce again but this time we're not relying on ChromeOS for anything. The good news here is that hardware acceleration works! The bad news is that there are some performance problems and also that your Chromebook Graphics Card is probably terrible anyway. I can't help with the latter. But let's try to fix some of those performance issues.\nYou might have a laggy mouse. To fix it temporarily, pop open the terminal and type:\n1synclient FingerLow=1 FingerHigh=5 If that fixed your trackpad issue then you can make it permanent on boot by creating a file at /mnt/stateful_partition/crouton/chroots/xenial/etc/X11/Xsession.d/80synaptics and entering the above info. The file would end up looking like:\n# Touchpad sensibility (move) synclient FingerLow=1 synclient FingerHigh=5 For the keyboard lag, we'll take a nod from the solution presented in this thread by Adam and copy over the Intel SNA driver.\n1sudo cp /etc/crouton/xorg-intel-sna.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf Exit and re-enter your xorg xfce chroot and let's take a look at the same metrics. This time looking at glxinfo will show a Vendor string of Intel. And glxgears is going to match your screen refresh rate (probably 60fps). Congrats, you've now got hardware acceleration! You probably can't play anything too beefy but you'll have slightly better performance. If you're using Lutris, you might get dxvk enabled as well for an incremental gain.\nLastly, I should mention that I primarily use cli-extra to just work at the command line. I think this is the happy place for Crouton and where most people use it successfully. But regardless, I hope you find your chromebook useful!\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2018-07-07-fix-keyboard-lag-crouton/","section":"post","tags":["chromeos","crouton","xorg"],"title":"Fixing keyboard and mouse lag in Xorg (crouton)"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/tags/postgresql/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Postgresql"},{"body":"In a previous article, we set up your Debian Buster system with git, ruby, and a bash shell that tells you the ruby version and branch.

Something has been eating at me though and I find myself pining for my old linux desktop. Since buying a new rig for kicks is out of the question, I instead dug up a beat up IBM T22 and grabbed my Kubuntu Alternative Install CD and went to it.\nUnfortunately, Kubuntu didn't install in the two times I tried it. It's unusual and is probably a reflection of my hardware more than it is Ubuntu. Still, I had an itch to scratch and I was determined to get at it. Enter Arch Linux. I've used Arch before and this article isn't about how it does on the Desktop or how well it installs. If you want to figure that out go find a review or, better yet, grab an ISO and install it yourself. (Arch installs nicely on VMWare Fusion BTW..)\nAfter getting up and running with Arch again, I discovered there are things about it that I just absolutely love. Here are my top 10.\nIt's fast. Yes, it's an i686 distro and while you might think that I'd grow impatient waiting for an application to launch on my aging 128MB RAM T22, you'd be wrong. It's actually quite snappy and I'm surprised. I've got both KDE and Fluxbox installed and they are both serviceable. Lack of bloat is a good thing.\nIt's got a lean base. I recall a few years ago when I was overseas, I made a bad, stupid, mistake that ruined my linux install. I didn't bring a spare ISO with me but I needed to get work done. I had the choice of downloading a slew of distros but ended up grabbing Archlinux. The lean 140MB base CD downloaded in a few hours (slooow connections overseas back then) and installed in under 25 minutes. From there was I able to start downloading applications in one terminal while simultaneously working in the other.\nIt's unbiased. KDE? Fluxbox? Gnome? Who cares! With Arch, you make the decisions so if you don't want something don't install it. If you want something, go grab it. Nothing is given more attention than the other and that's because the community has a varied user base with their own preferences. Somebody in there uses a similar setup to the one you're thinking about.\nThe community. It's been said that some people use *nix because they hate Windows while other use *nix because they love Unix. (I've left the exact phrase vague for fear of starting a flame war.) I think I use Archlinux because I love linux and I think many in the Arch community feel the same way. The result is a strong, respectful community forum, a well documented wiki, and nice IRC Channel too.\nRC.CONF. Wait, you love Archlinux because of a file? Yes I do. Everything you need to mess with is in this file. Want to start a daemon on boot? Here you go. Want to eliminate a module from getting loaded? It's in there too. What about setting your IP address? Yup, it's covered. Overall, I find it lovely and I think many Arch users would agree.\nPacman. Arch comes with a great, powerful package manager too. Unlike his peers, Pacman won't start installing packages without asking you first. What I mean by that is if you do a sudo apt-get install Foo, it'll go and do it. OTOH, if you type pacman -S Foo, you'll get a breakdown of what's being installed and then pacman will request permission to go ahead.\nIt's a learning distro. Yeah, you need to know linux to really use it. Sure, it doesn't auto configure much. (In fact, sometimes I feel it screws up some things on purpose just to see if you're paying attention!) X11 won't work by default and neither will sound, suspend to ram, or much of anything else. But, it's all manageable thanks to the great community and documentation and you will learn a ton about linux while doing it. Much of that learning will stay with you no matter which distro you end up with.\nIt rolls with it. Arch is a rolling distro so it's always up to date. Simply typing pacman -Syu will update your installation to the latest greatest everything. Sounds like a nightmare for a server but it's actually never let me down even after long periods of neglecting it. Still, I looove my install so I care and feed it daily. It blooms.\nIt's current. With Arch, the packages are in the repository very quickly after they're released. Sometimes it doesn't become generally available (they do test) but if you want it you can enable the testing repository and help out with the bug hunt. Regardless, it's my experience that the versions of the packages in Arch are always further along. It's nice to have the latest greatest and it's also nice to know if a current version of a package fixes or adds a feature I'm interested in. If so, I'll take the time to compile it on the linux distro I use for my servers (Ubuntu).\nOk, there's no number 10 and I lied.. this is just a Top 9. Sorry folks! Take a minute to suggest a 10th thing and maybe I'll append it to this list.\nIn any case, Arch isn't the only distro with the above great things and I obviously am not trying to imply that it's better than your favorite distro either. But, I do really enjoy it. A little later on I'll probably publish my list of 5 things I hate about Archlinux. But I'm only up to two at this point so it'll be a while until that list is fully compiled. Still, I'm sure some of you have suggestions for me. ;)\n","link":"https://greycloak.com/post/2007-05-31-ten-things-archlinux/","section":"post","tags":["archlinux","linux"],"title":"Ten Things I Love About ArchLinux"},{"body":"","link":"https://greycloak.com/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
